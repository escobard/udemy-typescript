# section 2 - overview

## two categories to learn typescript
- syntax + features
- design patterns

## type
- easy way to refer to the different properties + functions that a value has
  - eg:
    - function type
    - object type
    - array type
    - variable type
    - etc
- types are used by the typescript compiler to analyze our code for errors
- types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase
- types allows you to AVOID type-checking in unit tests, potentially lowering your number of unit tests & improving coverage!
- pre-define the properties and methods that a value has
