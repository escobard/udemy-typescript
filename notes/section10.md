# section 10 - ts design patterns continued
- build a single sorting algorythm, make it re-usable for many different types of sorting
- implement strong interface and class inheritance to simplify solution
- build an app that can run directly with the node.js terminal
- establish base design pattern for modular typescript apps
  - use tsconfig.ts file
- after code is compiled, you can check that the compiled code works with node.js by running `node build/index.js`

## tsc commands
- `tsc - w` - compiles all code continously
