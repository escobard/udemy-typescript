# TS metadata
- a proposed feature to be added to js (not just TS)
    - experimental in nature, but been around so far
- a snippet of info that can be tied to a method, property or class definition
- can be used for super custom stuff
- typescript will (optionally) provide type information as metadata
- read and written using the reflect-metadata package
