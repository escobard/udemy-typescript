# TS metadata
- a proposed feature to be added to js (not just TS)
    - experimental in nature, but been around so far
- a snippet of info that can be tied to a method, property or class definition
- can be used for super custom stuff
- typescript will (optionally) provide type information as metadata
- read and written using the reflect-metadata package
- can create a small hidden object within a data ts object
- is an additional object (with content) that can be attached to objects or object keys and act independently
  - for example:
    - colors:{ color: red }
    - can define metadata {'some data'} to colors.color === red.
    - can get metadata under colors.color === red
