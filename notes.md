# typescript with react redux

## pros
- easier to avoid extremely common typos
- a better understanding of the type of data flowing around
- much easier to refactor almost everything

## cons
- not the best type definition files (especially around redux)
- tons of generics flying around, harder to understand type definition files
- tons of imports, need to be aware of different types
- redux is inherently functional in nature, tough integration with TS classes
